# Eat-Da-Burger!

## Description
In this repository you will find Eat-Da-Burger, a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever the user submits a burger's name, it will be displayed on the left side of the screen until it is devoured. Once devoured, it will be disabled and move to the right side of the page.

This application was built using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, Bootstrap and a homemade ORM.
